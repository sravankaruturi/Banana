# Banana

This is a Game Engine I made to test out various forms of rendering etc. 

To run this project, please clone the repositories and the submodules.

Then run the GenerateProjects.bat script to generate the Visual Studio Projects.

There is an external dependency on Assimp ( https://github.com/assimp/ ) to run it though.

Please compile Assimp and drop in the dll and lib files accordingly and the Sandbox should build and run with no issues.
